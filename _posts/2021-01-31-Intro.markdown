Hello, and welcome to this website!  
Through this activity-based tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- `Fork` a repository
- `Clone` a repository
- Add your files (in the right format for the purposes of the project), including but not limited to:
  - Name, and other personal details
  - Profile image
  - Links
- `Commit`, and `Push` your changes to the repository
- Confirming the pull request

## Forking the repository

Background information about forking: <a style="color:blue" href= "https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo" target="_blank">Github Documentation</a>

A fork is a _copy_ of a repository.

Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. This is something you'd want to do on a regular basis, to make sure that your changes work and do not affect any other part of the project in an adverse manner.  
These are the steps to follow:

- Navigate to the <a style="color:blue" href= "https://github.com/zense/JuniorsGitTutorial" target="_blank">repo</a>, and click on the `fork` button.
- This should create a repo with the name of the form `YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`

## Cloning the forked repository

Background information about cloning: <a style="color:blue" href= "https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository" target="_blank">Github Documentation</a>

When you clone a repository, you _copy_ the repository from GitHub to your local machine.  
These are the steps to follow:

- Open your terminal window, and navigate to a newly created folder. An example implementation is:
  - `mkdir MyIntro`
  - `cd MyIntro`
- Then, go to your forked repository, click on the green code button and copy the link provided.
- Then, go to your terminal and paste it. It could be of the form, `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`
- This will create a folder with the name of the repository, do `cd JuniorsGitTutorial` to enter the folder

### Adding your files and information

Now for the fun part!  
You'll need the following files ready:

- A background picture for your post. Call it `YOUR-ROLL-NUMBER-BACKGROUND.jpg`

Now, open your code editor of choice, and add the image as follows:

- Add `YOUR-ROLL-NUMBER-BACKGROUND.jpg` into `img` folder.

For the post itself, we'll use the follwing format:

_Filename_: `2021-01-01-<YOUR-ROLL-NUMBER>.markdown`

```

Feel free to add your creative touch to the segments, but make sure to only modify the content below the two `---` placeholders. Create this file and add it to the `_posts` folder.

Psst. Check this out for some markdown syntax: <a style="color:blue" href= "https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" target="_blank">Markdown basic guide</a>

### Committing and Pushing your changes

First, let's add the files. This is done by performing the following commands:

- `git add img/YOUR-ROLL-NUMBER-BACKGROUND.jpg` 
- `git add _posts/2021-01-01-<YOUR-ROLL-NUMBER>.markdown`

Now, type `git status`. It should be all green.

Now, we commit our files by typing &nbsp; `git commit -m "Added files for YOUR-ROLL-NUMBER"`.

Finally, we push the changes by typing &nbsp; `git push`.

### Confirming the pull request

Go back to your created repo on github and click on the `Compare and Pull request`. Add relevant additional information, and you're done!

### Celebration Time

We hope that everything went smmoothly. If not, do not hesitate to contact us :)
